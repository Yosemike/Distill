Knowledge is knowing vegetables are good for us, wisdom is eating them.

But this blog is not **just** about eating vegetables. Distill Institute is where I extract and compress the lessons I learned into tools for better health, habits and productivity.

I write to connect my thoughts, to document what I learned so I can revisit them and so that you can use them at the same time too. While I am writing entirely for myself, I am writing for you too.

Life should always be bigger than this, no matter what “this” is. There’s always room of improvement and then we die. This is an axiom that the little boy in me never let die. When I was 13 and playing basketball, I told myself that. While I never became the next Michael Jordan that I fully expected myself to be, I learned a few things about self-improvement.

I write with three focuses for this blog: health, habits and productivity. These are the three things that I find contribute most to my growth. There are many other aspects of course, but I figured if I had these three nailed, it will set a foundation strong enough to hold other tools and tricks.
